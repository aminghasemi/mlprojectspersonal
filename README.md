Machine Learning Personal Projects to learn and make. 

The course I learned from machine learning is linked here:

It is very compehensive and useful for learning machine learning. it has also some trainings about data libraries of Python. 

I am going to put the projects I did during this course. However I completed this course about a year ago. But I am going to put the practices I've done here.
